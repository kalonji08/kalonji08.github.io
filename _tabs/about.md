I am a Microbiologist and Data Scientist currently completing my PhD in Molecular Biology at the [University of the Witwatersrand](https://www.wits.ac.za/). My current research focuses on plant microbiomes, specifically extracting microbial DNA and proteins to better understand their roles in plants. My academic background includes biomedicine, biotechnology, and molecular biology. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege to engage in both wet lab benchwork and computational work. I'm proficient in a variety of microbiological techniques, including microbial culture, nucleic acid extraction, protein extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concurrently, I've gained experience with large-scale biological data produced through [next-generation sequencing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6528456/) and proteomics data obtained via [Liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643089/).

This combination of laboratory and computational skills sparked my interest in data science, and I learned how to code, perform big data analytics, and explore large complex data sets. My goal as a scientist is to simplify complex concepts for better understanding, a skill acquired through tertiary-level teaching, lecturing, and academic content development. My drive is to distil meaningful insights from intricate data and communicate them effectively. Transitioning these skills to the field of Data Science has been thrilling, allowing me to apply insights learnt from biological data to a variety of industries. Beyond my professional endeavours, I joy in assembling computers, engaging in photography (both film and digital), and playing musical instruments.
