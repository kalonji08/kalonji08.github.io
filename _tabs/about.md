Hello, I'm Kalonji, and I work at the intersection of Molecular Biology, Computational Biology, and Data Science. 

My academic background spans biomedicine, bioinformatics, microbiology, and molecular biology, with experience in both wet-lab experiments and computational research. I have worked on omics across various systems from bacteria to humans, and specialise in multi-omics of microbial communities. Currently, I am focusing on human genetics to inform precision medicine in the future, with particular emphasis on contributing to the underrepresented genetics of African populations. 

Through developing computational frameworks for population-scale datasets, I aim to contribute insights that could inform targeted therapies and improved patient outcomes. I also apply these computational skills to solve other real-world data-related problems.

Outside of work, I enjoy  capturing images with both film and digital cameras, playing musical instruments, and travelling.
