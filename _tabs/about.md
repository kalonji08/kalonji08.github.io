Hi, my name is Kalonji. I am a Researcher (PhD candidate) in Molecular Biology at the [University of the Witwatersrand](https://www.wits.ac.za/) and a Junior Data Scientist at [Fathom Data](https://www.fathomdata.dev/). I have nearly five years of experience in teaching and lecturing at tertiary academic institutions, and developing various academic contents.

My current research focuses on plant microbiomes, specifically extracting microbial DNA and proteins to better understand their roles in plants. My academic background includes biomedicine, biotechnology, and molecular biology. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege to engage in both wet lab benchwork and computational work.

Outside of work, I enjoy building computers, taking photos with both film and digital cameras, playing musical instruments, and travelling.
