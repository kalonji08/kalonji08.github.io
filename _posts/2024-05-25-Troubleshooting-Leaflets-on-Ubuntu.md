The Leaflet package stands out as a powerful tool for creating interactive maps in R. However, for users navigating the Linux Ubuntu environment, installing Leaflet can sometimes be accompanied by unexpected challenges. In this blog post, we'll explore the common hurdles encountered when installing the Leaflet package and provide step-by-step solutions to overcome them.

**The Challenge: Installation Hurdles**

Picture this scenario: you're eager to incorporate interactive maps into your R projects using the Leaflet package. Excitedly, you attempt to install the package using `install.packages("leaflet")` in your R console. To your dismay, the installation process is halted by a series of errors, leaving you scratching your head in frustration.

**Why Leaflet?**

Leaflet is renowned for its intuitive interface and rich feature set, making it a top choice for developers and data enthusiasts alike. However, to fully harness its capabilities, Leaflet relies on underlying dependencies such as `terra` and `raster`, which, in turn, necessitate system-level libraries like GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library).

**The Issue: GDAL Configuration**

The crux of the problem lies in the configuration of GDAL, a crucial component for spatial data processing. During the installation of Leaflet's dependencies, the absence or misconfiguration of GDAL can thwart progress, leading to errors such as:

```
configure: error: gdal-config not found or not executable.

```

This error message signals that the installation process for Leaflet's dependencies has hit a roadblock due to the unavailability of GDAL configuration files.

**The Solution: Installing GDAL**

To surmount this obstacle, you'll need to ensure GDAL is properly configured on your Linux Ubuntu system. Fear not, for the solution is within reach:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev

```

Executing this command installs the GDAL development files, including the indispensable `gdal-config`, which is pivotal for successful installation of Leaflet and its associated dependencies.

**Implementing the Solution**

With GDAL now primed and ready on your system, you can proceed with confidence to install the Leaflet package in R:

```r
install.packages("leaflet")

```

Voila! With GDAL seamlessly integrated into your environment, the installation process for Leaflet should now proceed without a hitch, paving the way for captivating interactive maps in your R projects.
