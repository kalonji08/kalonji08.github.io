# How to Run SSPACE Basic for Genome Assembly Scaffolding

---

SSPACE Basic is a powerful tool used in bioinformatics to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies by scaffolding contigs using paired-end and mate-pair sequencing data. This guide will walk you through the steps to correctly run SSPACE Basic on a Linux system, from installation to execution, using detailed code examples.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Linux system
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- Internet connection for downloading the tool
- Installed Perl and necessary Perl modules

### Step 1: Download and Install SSPACE Basic

1. **Download SSPACE Basic**:
    
    ```bash
    wget <http://bioinfo.genomics.org.cn/SSPACE/SSPACE_Basic_v2.0.tar.gz>
    
    ```
    
2. **Extract the Tarball**:
    
    ```bash
    tar -xvzf SSPACE_Basic_v2.0.tar.gz
    
    ```
    
3. **Navigate to the SSPACE Directory**:
    
    ```bash
    cd SSPACE_Basic_v2.0
    
    ```
    
4. **Ensure Dependencies**:
Make sure Perl is installed and the necessary modules are available:
    
    ```bash
    perl -v
    sudo cpan Getopt::Long
    sudo cpan File::Basename
    
    ```
    

### Step 2: Add SSPACE Basic to Your PATH

To run the SSPACE Basic script from anywhere, add its directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

1. **Open Your Shell Configuration File**:
For Bash:
    
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    
    ```
    
    For Zsh:
    
    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    
    ```
    
2. **Add the SSPACE Directory to PATH**:
    
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/SSPACE_Basic_v2.0
    
    ```
    
3. **Source the Configuration File**:
For Bash:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    
    ```
    
    For Zsh:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    
    ```
    

### Step 3: Prepare Input Files

1. **Scaffolds File**:
Ensure your scaffolds file is in FASTA format. Example:
    
    ```
    /path/to/your/balance_SC.fasta
    
    ```
    
2. **Libraries File**:
Create a `libraries.txt` file containing information about your paired-end reads:
    
    ```
    lib1 /path/to/unmapped_SCOMGI1_1.fastq /path/to/unmapped_SCOMGI1_2.fastq 500 0.05 FR
    
    ```
    

### Step 4: Running SSPACE Basic

Navigate to the directory containing your files and run the command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/files/
perl /path/to/SSPACE_Basic_v2.0/SSPACE_Basic.pl -l libraries.txt -s balance_SC.fasta -x 1 -T 16 -b SCoutput_folder

```

### Detailed Command Breakdown

- `l libraries.txt`: Specifies the file with library information.
- `s balance_SC.fasta`: Specifies the input scaffolds file.
- `x 1`: Indicates to extend the contigs.
- `T 16`: Specifies the number of threads to use.
- `b SCoutput_folder`: Base name for your output files, effectively specifying the output directory.

### Example Directory Structure

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

```
/path/to/your/files/
  ├── balance_SC.fasta
  ├── unmapped_SCOMGI1_1.fastq
  ├── unmapped_SCOMGI1_2.fastq
  └── libraries.txt

```

### Example Libraries File

Here’s an example `libraries.txt` file with one library:

```
lib1 /path/to/unmapped_SCOMGI1_1.fastq /path/to/unmapped_SCOMGI1_2.fastq 500 0.05 FR

```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Invalid File Paths**:
Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
2. **Permissions**:
Make sure files have the appropriate read permissions:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +r /path/to/your/files/*
    
    ```
    
3. **Check Standard Deviation Proportion**:
Ensure the standard deviation is a fraction between 0.00 and 1.00.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively use SSPACE Basic to scaffold your genome assemblies, improving the contiguity and quality of your genome sequence. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough to ensure you can run SSPACE Basic successfully, from installation to execution. Happy scaffolding!
