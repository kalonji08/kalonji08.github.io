# Hello world !

Welcome to my very first blog. This has been an idea that I've contemplated for about three years. I'm glad that I have finally gathered the courage to put myself out there.

The phrase 'Hello World' is quite the iconic statement, particularly in programming, as it is typically the first line of code one is instructed to output.

``` python
 print ("Hello world")
 ```

In a similar fashion, this "Hello World" marks the beginning of my blogging journey!

My goal with this blog is to document my journey. I will tell you more about myself, but in the meantime, you can read my [About Me page](https://kalonji08.github.io/about/)


I serendipitously discovered my passion for biology and computers while pursuing my PhD. Finding myself at this intersection is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me.

I would love to share what I have learned and will continue to learn from both worlds. Additionally, I'll provide wisdom nuggets from books, podcasts, and other blogs I have read. 

I will also share some study tips. Having been a student for the major part of my existence, and now experiencing the other side of itâ€”teaching, lecturing, setting exams, and all those fun stuff for almost half a decade. I would love to share some advice too!

That's it for now. Looking forward to the journey ahead.
