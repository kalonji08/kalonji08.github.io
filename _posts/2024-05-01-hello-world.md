# Helo wolrd

Well, Hello World

Welcome to my very first blog. This has been an idea that I've contemplated for about three years now, but I have finally gathered the courage to put myself out there and share this first message: "Hello World".

"Hello World" is such an iconic sentence, especially in programming because, in most tutorials, it is the first command they make you print, lol.

``` python
 print ("Hello world")
 ```

 As my instructor would say: " That's it, you have written your first code and started a great journey to becoming a programmer"

 Similarly, this is my first blog post, "Hello World", and so begins my journey of becoming a blogger.

My goal with this blog is to document my journey. I will tell you more about myself, but in the meantime, you can read my [About Me page](/_tabs/about.md)


I serendipitously discovered my passion for biology and computers while pursuing my PhD. Finding myself at this intersection is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me.

I would love to share what I have learned and will continue to learn from both worlds. Additionally, I'll provide wisdom nuggets from books, podcasts, and other blogs I have read. 

I will also share some study tips. Having been a student for the major part of my existence, and now experiencing the other side of itâ€”teaching, lecturing, setting exams, and all those fun stuff for almost half a decade. I would love to share some advice too!

That's it for now. Looking forward to the journey ahead.
